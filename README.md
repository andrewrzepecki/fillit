# Fillit
First Algo Project @ 42 Paris.

**Project score : [111 / 100]**

Fillit is an algorithmic sorting project which consists of sorting an unordered list of numbers using only two stacks, A and B, while only using the following limited actions:

 - sa : swap a - inverts the two first elements at the top of stack A.
 - sb : swap b - interts the two first elements at the top of stack B.
 - ss : sa & sb at the same time.
 - pa : push a - puts the first element of stack B on top of stack A.
 - pb : push a - puts the first element of stack A on top of stack B.
 - ra : rotate a - move up all elements of stack A. The first element becomes the last.
 - rb : rotate a - move up all elements of stack B. The first element becomes the last.
 - rr : ra & rb at the same time.
 - rra : reverse rotate a - move down all elements of stack A. The last element becomes the first.
 - rrb : reverse rotate a - move down all elements of stack B. The last element becomes the first.
 - rrr : rra & rrb at the same time.


## Installation and usage

```
git clone https://github.com/andrewrzepecki/fillit && cd fillit && make
```

The program recieves a file containing valid tetriminos in this format:

![fillit](png/tetris_pieces.png)

Tetriminos pieces must be 4x4 format, using '#' and '.' to form the piece, and must be seperated by a newline.

**Example:**

```
./fillit [tetris_pieces]
```

![fillit](png/fillit_output.png)

The tetriminos pieces are distinguished with their own unique character: 'A' for the first tetriminos supplied, 'B' for the second, 'C' for the third ...

The concept of our algorithm is to recursively test each tetriminos, starting in an area the size of the sum of the given tetriminos areas.
